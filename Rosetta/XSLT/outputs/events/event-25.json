Known as the Reformation this movement had far-reaching effects.\r\n\r\nAt the Diet of Worms in 1521 Luther was condemned by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, but he received support from a number of German princes, including Frederick the Wise of Saxony, the patron of  Cranach and  Durer.\r\n\r\nThe humanist scholar  Erasmus opposed the Reformation, but his criticism of the corruption within the Catholic Church caused him to be attacked by both sides.\r\n\r\nIn 1534, following the Pope's refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII became the Supreme Head of a new national Church of England.  Holbein's famous portrait of the King dates from around this period."}]}]
