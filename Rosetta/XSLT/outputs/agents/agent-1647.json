During his long career, he experimented with many different styles of painting which embody the development of art during his epoch.\r\n\r\nYouth and debut\r\n\r\nTitian (Tiziano Vecellio) was born in Pieve di Cadore, a small town at the foot of the Dolomites on the Venetian side of the Alps. The Vecellios had been based in Cadore since the 14th century. Titian’s father, Gregorio, was a military man. His older brother Francesco was also a painter. There is still no documentary evidence of Titian’s exact date of birth, but contemporary sources and his early stylistic development suggest that he was born around 1490.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about 10 years old, Titian arrived in Venice, then one of the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world.\r\n\r\nTitian started his artistic training in the workshop of the mosaicist Sebastiano Zuccato. He later briefly joined Gentile Bellini’s workshop. After Gentile’s death in 1507, Titian joined the workshop of Gentile's brother, Giovanni Bellini, which at that time was the most important in Venice.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was through contact with Giorgione, who had also previously trained in Giovanni Bellini’s workshop, that he mainly developed his early style. The Giorgionesque appearance of Titian’s early work, which is characterised by a pastoral mood, is proof of their closeness. In 1508-9 they worked together on the decoration of the external walls of the ‘Fondaco dei Tedeschi’ in Venice. The parts executed by Titian were greatly praised by contemporaries, much to the annoyance of Giorgione.\r\n\r\nAfter Giorgione’s death in 1510, and Sebastiano del Piombo’s departure to Rome in 1511, Titian launched his independent career in Venice. He was now left without rivals among his generation who could compete at his level.\r\n\r\nEarly local success\r\n\r\nIn 1511 Titian painted his celebrated frescoes in the ‘Scuola del Santo’ in Padua. His style had now reached maturity, marked by fullness of forms, compositional confidence and chromatic balance. These features made his work fundamental to the development of Venetian – and also European – painting.\r\n\r\nHe became famous as a portraitist (examples in the National Gallery are La Schiavona and Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo). He was also known as a painter of various profane subjects. These skills drew the attention of intellectually ambitious Italian dukes and aristocrats.\r\n\r\nTitian was also commissioned to paint prestigious public religious paintings. His Venetian success was sealed by the execution of the altarpiece for the high altar of the important Franciscan church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice. The so-called ‘Assunta’ (Assumption of the Virgin Mary), which is nearly seven metres high, was displayed in 1518, creating a revolutionary watershed in Venetian altarpiece design.\r\n\r\nBetween 1519 and 1526, he painted the celebrated ‘Pala Pesaro’ for the same church. This asymmetrical composition strongly influenced Venetian altarpiece painting right up until the 18th century.\r\n\r\nNorth Italian courts\r\n\r\nEarly in 1516 Titian started his professional relationship with Alfonso I d’Este, Duke of Ferrara and spent time in Alfonso’s castle. The duke wanted to create a private cabinet, which would be known as the ‘camerino d’alabastro’ (the alabaster cabinet), with mythological scenes derived from classical poetry.\r\n\r\nThe duke employed the painters he considered to be the best at the time. Apart from Titian, the other artists were Raphael, Fra Bartolomeo and Dosso Dossi. Following the deaths of Raphael and Fra Bartolomeo Titian’s involvement in the project increased.
