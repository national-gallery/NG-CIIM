Titian mainly painted portraits for the Mantuan court.</p><p>In 1532 Titian started to work for the Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria della Rovere. He would also work for his successor, Guidobaldo II. In the 1530s, he was also in touch with the court of Pope Paolo III Farnese.</p><h2>Worldwide success, family and friends</h2><p>The 1520s were hugely significant for Titian’s private life. In 1525 he married Cecilia (who tragically died in 1530). Titian and Cecilia had three children, who were all given the names of famous figures from ancient Rome: Pompeo, Orazio and Lavinia.</p><p>Titian’s meeting with the Holy Roman <a href=\"/paintings/glossary/emperor-charles-v\">Emperor Charles V</a> in Bologna in 1530 would be a determining event in his life. On this occasion Titian executed a (now lost) full-length, life-size portrait of the Emperor - an early example of what was still an extremely innovative genre at that time.</p><p>He rapidly became the principal painter to the imperial court, which gave him immense privileges, honours and even titles. From this moment he was the painter most in demand at courts across Europe. Titian also became the official painter of Charles V’s son, <a href=\"/paintings/glossary/philip-ii\">Philip II of Spain</a>. Starting in about 1551, he painted the celebrated mythological series of pictures for Philip, which he referred to as ‘poesie’. <br /><br />The 'poesie' included <a href=\"/paintings/titian-diana-and-actaeon\">Diana and Actaeon</a> and <a href=\"/paintings/titian-diana-and-callisto\" class=\"amax-link-ConObject-3050\">Diana and Callisto</a>, which are now part of the National Gallery's collection, along with <a href=\"/paintings/titian-the-death-of-actaeon\" class=\"amax-link-ConObject-806\">The Death of Actaeon</a>, which was originally conceived as part of the series, but in fact remained unfinished in the artist's studio at his death.</p><p>In 1527 the Florentine sculptor and architect Jacopo Sansovino and the Tuscan man of letters Pietro Aretino arrived in Venice.
