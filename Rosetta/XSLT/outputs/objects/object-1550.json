The process was set in motion on 10 September by Jacopo Bellucci, head priest, and the confraternity quickly decided the work should show the Trinity with two saints on each side. Three saints were chosen &ndash; <a class=\"dokuwiki_link\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/1258712341\">Zeno, Jerome</a> and James, patron of Pistoia and <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/2789390062\">patron saint</a> of Jacopo Bellucci &ndash; but the fourth was more difficult. Eventually Per ser Landi, the treasurer who was in charge of the commission, suggested Mamas, to whom he was personally devoted.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The confraternity were closely involved in the developing design of the altarpiece. Landi made trips to Florence to get the contract signed and fetch drawings, some of which survive. A sketch of Saints Zeno and Mamas in the Uffizi, Florence, is thought to be a preliminary design by <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/1727996221\">Pesellino</a> to show the  priests his proposal for the new work, though there are differences between this and the final version: Mamas&rsquo;s gesture in the drawing is used for Zeno in the painting, for example. Landi carried on making regular trips to Florence up to Pesellino&rsquo;s death in July 1457, presumably to oversee the progress of the painting &ndash; but perhaps also because he liked the city. By October that year he was in disgrace, for financial mismanagement and for visiting Florence too often.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The altarpiece was described as half-finished when Pesellino died, and work was halted for a year before a new artist was found. It was eventually given to <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/735011332\">Fra Filippo Lippi</a> to finish off, and was finally delivered to the priests in 1460, five years after it was commissioned.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Like many artists, Pesellino borrowed ideas from other artists and reused figures in different contexts.
