It was made for the church of San Pier Maggiore, one of the oldest and most respected churches in Florence. In it, we see saints arranged in five orderly rows that ascend diagonally towards the panel's right edge, where it meets the central image.Each saint has been painted in great detail. They each wear different robes (often highly decorated), have different hairstyles and hair colours, and carry objects that identify them. Often, they are painted with objects associated with their martyrdom: Saint Stephen, shown kneeling in the front row, has a flat white stone on his head, a reminder that he was stoned to death for his Christian faith. Next to him, Saint Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, carries a large knife.On the right of Bartholomew is Saint Peter wearing his usual colours of yellow and blue. He carries a large key and, balanced on his knee, is a model of San Pier Maggiore. The key represents the keys to the kingdom of heaven that Christ had promised him; the building reminds the viewer that Peter is the patron saint of the church, but also that Christ told Peter that he was the rock upon which he would build his church (Matthew 16: 18). He is placed in the position of honour, at the Virgin's right hand. Many of the saints wear elaborate robes, and the gold leaf decoration would have twinkled in the candlelit church. Saint Mary Magdalene's red robe, prominent at the left edge of the second tier, is embroidered with the Greek letters 'IHS' and 'XPS', standing for 'Jesus' and 'Christus'.The saints included have been carefully selected, probably by the wealthy Florentine Albizzi family who paid for the altarpiece. Saint Peter was the name saint of Piero di Filippo degli Albizzi (who died in 1379), who may have been the painting's chief patron. He was a director of one of the wool companies owned by the Albizzi family, who made their money trading in this commodity. Saint Stephen was the patron saint of the Florentine wool guild and therefore an important saint for the family, explaining his prominence here.  Bartholomew was a common name in the Albizzi family and one particular man, Bartolommeo di Gherardo degli Albizzi (who had died by 1385), was a director of another wool company at the time that the altarpiece was commissioned. His daughter was a nun at convent of San Pier Maggiore. Another Albizzi, Bartolommeo di bellincione degli Albizzi (who died 7 July 1400) was married to a woman called Maddalena, after Mary Magdalene, who occupies an important position here.Saint Zenobius, Florence's patron saint and first bishop, is shown centrally in the second row, wearing his bishop's mitre. The altarpiece played an important role in the ordination of the Bishop of Florence, forming the backdrop to part of the ceremony when the Bishop would sit in a throne in front of this picture. This might be why Saint John the Evangelist, at the right of the second row, is shown holding open his gospel at the words of Revelation: 'a great multitude... from every nation... standing before the throne and before the Lamb...' (Revelation 7: 9)."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300435416","type":"Type","_label":"Description","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300418049","type":"Type","_label":"short text"}]}],"content":"The saints arranged here neatly in rows are looking towards the central panel of the complex, four-tiered altarpiece that this picture comes from, which shows Christ crowning the Virgin Mary. This scene is mirrored on a panel on the other side of the central image. Together, these three panels together formed the main level of the altarpiece.Wealthy wool traders, the Albizzi family, commissioned the altarpiece for the Florentine church of San Pier Maggiore. Included here are saints that were significant to the family: Saint Stephen in the front row, for example, was the patron saint of the guild that controlled the Florentine wool trade. He has a stone on his head which refers to his death by stoning."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300026687","type":"Type","_label":"Credit Statement","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300418049","type":"Type","_label":"Full Text"}]}],"content":"Bought, 1857"}],"member_of":[{"type":"Set","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0J3A-0008-0000-0000","_label":"Eastlake Acquisitions (on display only)"}],"subject_of":[{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0DWG-0008-0000-0000","_label":"National Gallery Catalogues: The Italian Paintings before 1400"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0E3Q-0008-0000-0000","_label":"National Gallery Catalogues: The Earlier Italian Schools"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0E04-0008-0000-0000","_label":"National Gallery Catalogues: The Earlier Italian Schools"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0DXY-0008-0000-0000","_label":"National Gallery Catalogues: The Early Italian Schools before 1400"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0E1Z-0008-0000-0000","_label":"The National Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0VKN-0009-0000-0000","_label":"The National Gallery Companion Guide"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0VMT-0009-0000-0000","_label":"100 Great Paintings"},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0X5X-0005-0000-0000","_label":"More than meets the eye : a closer look at paintings in the National Gallery \/Michael Cassin."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0R8C-0005-0000-0000","_label":"The National Gallery : review of the year, April 2008 – March 2009."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0MGR-0005-0000-0000","_label":"One hundred great paintings \/ Louise Govier."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/08OB-0007-0000-0000","_label":"A closer look : faces \/Alexander Sturgis."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/08WA-0007-0000-0000","_label":"Sassetta : the Borgo San Sepolcro altarpiece \/edited by Machtelt Israëls."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0X2C-0005-0000-0000","_label":"Devotion by design : Italian altarpieces before 1500 \/Scott Nethersole."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","id":"https:\/\/data.ng.ac.uk\/0WWD-0005-0000-0000","_label":"»Kult Bild« : das Altar- und Andachtsbild von Duccio bis Perugino \/Ausstellung und Katalog von Jochen Sander mit Beiträgen von Matthias Th.
