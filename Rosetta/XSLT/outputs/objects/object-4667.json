Engraved by Francesco Aquila, deidicated to G. P. bellori, 1691 1666 inventory of the Alcázar, Madrid and then in subsequent royal inventories up to that of 1789. These inventories which are preserved in the Royal Palace at Madrid are unpublished. The relevant entries are as follows: 1666 'no. 641 (old numeration) media vara de alta y un pie de ancho de una Nra. Sra. del mismo Corezo en 3,000 dus'. 1686 inventory (under heading 'Passillo que llaman de la Madona'-no inventory number) 'otra de media vara de alto, de una tercia de ancho, de una Nuestra Señora con el Niño original de mano del Corezo'. 1700 inventory (under heading 'Passillo de la Madona (old numeration) 42') 'Item, otra de media vara de alto y una tercia de ancho; de una Nuestra Señora con el Niño: original del mano del mismo Corezo, tasada en mil y quinientos doblones'. A media vara is about 16½ inches and a pie or tercia vara about 11 inches. The inventories of 1772 and 1789 repeat the measurements of '½ vara' high and '⅓ vara' wide. The fact that NG23 does not figure in the inventory of 1636 might be thought to indicate that it was among the important Italian paintings bought by Velázquez during his visit to Italy in 1648-51 but no positive evidence on this point has come to light. Furthermore, there is at least a possibility that no. 23 was the picture seen by Jusepe Martinez [-1682] in the possession of a certain Conde de San Clemente at Saragossa. The following passage is from his Discursos Practicables, datable around 1675, published by F. J. Sánchez Cantón in vol. 3 of Fuentes Literarias (1934), p. 28: En esta ciudad de Zaragosa se halla un cuadrito, en poder del Sr. Conde de San Clemente, de una tabla de roble de grandeza de poco más o menos de una tercia, pintada una imagen de Nuestra Señora que muda la camisa al Niño Jesus y en lejos San José trabajando su oficio. It is to be noted that no. 23 is on poplar, not on oak, and in consequence it may not have been identical with the Saragossa picture. NG23 was seen in Madrid by Mengs who published descriptions of it (Mengs: Opere, 1787, pp. 190 and 312). NG23 was also described by Antonio Conca (Descrizione Odeporica della Spagna, vol. 1, 1793, pp. 128, 129) in the Madrid palace.\r\n\r\n[3]. Next recorded in 1813 among pictures which Wallis was bringing from Spain to Buchanan in England. In Buchanan's list of that year stated to have come from 'The first collection at Madrid'. Exactly how or in what circumstances it left the Spanish royal collection is not known, and contrary to what is generally stated it is unlikely that it was ever in Godoy's possession. Nevertheless, the fact that Wallis was able to acquire it must be attributed to the upheavals consequent on the Peninsular War. Buchanan and Wallis having failed to find a buyer in England, the picture was taken back to the continent.\r\nIn the National Gallery catalogue of 1838 and in almost all subsequent works on the subject NG23 is stated to have been given by Charles IV of Spain to Emanuel Godoy, the 'Prince of the Peace' [1767-1851]. This seems very doubtful. There is no mention of Godoy in any of the (fairly circumstantial) accounts of the picture's pedigree which were published between Mengs' and the 1838 catalogue. George Yeates (letter of 19th January, 1814, to Thomas Penrice, published with the latter's correspondence), the Lapeyrière sale catalogue of 1825, Passavant (Kunstreise durch England und Belgien, 1833, p. 11), Niewenhuys (Review of the Lives and Works of some of the most Eminent Painters, 1834, p. 48), Ottley's National Gallery Catalogues of 1832 and 1835 or the Tübinger Kunstblatt of 17 May, 1836. Above all, the M. inventory of Godoy's collection dated 1 January, 1808 (only two and a half months before his arrest) contains no mention of any picture corresponding with NG23. The explanation of the error seems to be that the compiler of the 1838 National Gallery catalogue confused the history of NG10 and NG23, stating that the former passed from the Alba collection direct to that of Murat (whereas in fact it belonged to Godoy in between) and including Godoy's collection in the pedigree of NG23. Waagen,  in following this account says 'unhappily this gem, presented by Charles IV to the Prince of the Peace, has been injured in some parts by cleaning' and Meyer  embroidering this story, says that the picture suffered through cleaning while it was in Godoy's possession. Meyer's version was swallowed by Ricci (both editions). The resulting gap in the pedigree of NG23 is awkward but there seems no doubt that it really is the picture described by Mengs and recorded in the Spanish royal inventories, since Mengs gives a detailed description and accepts it as autograph, while the inventory dimensions tally well enough. It is significant too that the valuations in the inventories are exceptionally high for so small a picture. \r\n\r\n[4]. On the back of NG23 is a seal which is also found on the following other pictures in the National Gallery: Cuyp NG823, Heyden NG866, Hobbema NG831 and NG833, van de Velde NG871. Of these, all but Cuyp NG823 and Hobbema NG833 are known to have been at one time in the possession of a Nieuwenhuys. \r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n\r\n[a]. W.
