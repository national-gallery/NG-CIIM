The removal of NG35 to Rome by Cardinal Aldobrandini was little more than theft. Only five pictures were concerned-the four Bellini/Titian Bacchanals and one by Dosso (see NG5279). The memorandum describes NG35 as 'una pittura in quadro di mano di Tiziano dove era dipinto Lacoonte'. Such indeed is how the figure of the satyr towards the right might appear at first sight or, as here, in retrospect (since the picture had already gone when the memorandum was written). Although Titian had probably not seen the Laöcoön group when he   painted NG35 it is equally probable that its general appearance was known to him. At the same time the resemblance may be partly fortuitous, since the distinctive feature-the serpents writhing round the naked figure-occurs in Catullus. Included in Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's inventory of 1603 and in those of 1626, 1682 and an undated one (before 1665). Recorded in 1638 as in the Villa Aldobrandini, Rome. NG35 appears as no. 203 in the Aldobrandini inventories of 1605 and before 1665 (Palatino, 1964, p. 203) and as no. 100 in the 1626 inventory (Paola Della Pergola, 'Gli inventari Aldobrandin'i, Arte Antica e Moderna, 1960, p. 432) and as no. 314 in 1682 inventory (Poala Della Pergola, Arte Antica e Moderna, 'Gli inventari Aldobrandini. L’inventario del 1682', 1963, p. 74). \r\n\r\nThe writers referred to specify the location and at the same time use words which leave no doubt that the picture in question is NG35. Other writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are not referred to if references are vaguer-for example Ridolfi (Le Maraviglie dell'Arte) having described NG35 (p. 142), later gives its location (p. 178) simply as 'da gli heredi del Signor Cardinale Aldobrandino' It may be pointed out in this pace that Vasari, though describing the other Bacchanals at Ferrara, does not speak of NG35.  Gasp. Celio writes: 'Quella di Bacco ehe scende dal Carro e di Titiano-as in the Casino del Signor Principe Aldobrandini nel Montedetto Magnanapoli'.The Villa Aldobrandini at Rome is sometimes referred to in seventeenth-and eighteenth-century guidebooks, sometimes as Giardino Aldobrandini and sometimes as Villa Aldobrandini sopra al Quirinale, but there is no doubt that all refer to the same building. \r\n\r\n[2]. During this period the ownership had varied with the dynastic changes. The heir of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini  appears to have been Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini (son of Pietro's sister, Olimpia, who had married another Aldobrandini, Gianfrancesco) on whom, according to Litta, all the riches of the Aldobrandini family had devolved. Cardinal Ippolito, the last surviving Aldobrandini male of the main branch, entailing the estate and leaving as heir his niece, also called Olimpia (daughter of Ippolito's brother, Giorgio) and then her second son (by her second marriage-to Camillo Pamfilj) who had to take the name Aldobrandini. When this line too became extinct (in 1760) most of the Pamfili property passed to the Doria Landi while the Aldobrandini inheritance became the subject of a law suit between the Colonna and Borghese families, won by the latter in 1769. The judgement on that occasion was that the Aldobrandini fortune and title should be held by the second son of the head of the Borghese family. The confusion presumably prevailing over the inheritance between the years 1760 and 1769 may account for Volkmann's statement (published in 1770 but presumably referring to some time before) that NG35 was at the time of writing in the Palazzo Pamfili (that is, Palazzo Doria). Contrary to what is often stated NG35 appears never to have hung in the Palazzo Barberini. \r\n\r\nNikodemus Tessin in Studieresor, 1687-8 (ed. Sirén, 1914) p. 168 mentions' vier zimblich grosse Bachanalien vom Titiano' as in Palazzo Barberini and this was repeated by Carla Caterina Patina (Pitture Scelte, Cologne, 1691, p. 179) and by various eighteenth-century writers, while Milanesi (ed. of Vasari, VII, p. 434, note 1) and earlier editions of the National Gallery catalogue include the Barberini in the pedigree of NG35. The grounds for assuming that the pictures in question were copies are (a) the four original Bacchanals have never been together since the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Two were in Spain by 1638 (see W. N. Sainsbury: Original Unpublished Papers, Illustrative of ... Rubens, 1859, p. 353), (b) both Rossini (Il Mercurio Errante, 8th ed., 1760, p. 93) and the Roma Antica e Moderna (1765, II, p. 283) mention four Titian Bacchanals in Palazzo Barberini and also (pp. 271 and II, 607, respectively) NG35 as at the Villa Aldobrandini, (c) Orbaan (Documenti sul Barocco in Roma, 1920, p. 512) quotes a Barberini inventory of 1631 which says clearly that there was at that time in Palazzo Barberini a copy of what is certainly NG35, there stated as belonging to the Aldobrandini: 'un quadro d'un baccanario, con un satiretto, ehe tira la testa di un vitello, copiato dal Maltese da un di Titiano, che hanno li Signori Altobrandini, width about 6 Roman palmi'. \r\n\r\n[3]. The sojourn (in itself a little mysterious) of NG35 in Palazzo Doria seems at first to be rendered questionable by a curious statement of Ramdohr's  à propos the Villa Aldobrandini that 'diese Villa gehört nicht dem Hause Doria, wie H. Dr. Volkmann schreibt, sondern dem Hause Borghese'. Unfortunately the reference to Volkmann's book given in this connection by Ramdohr ( vol. II, p. 233) is wrong (page 233 of that work is about something quite different) and it is difficult to be sure to which of Volkmann's remarks Ramdohr is referring. In his description of the Villa Aldobrandini (p. 825) Volkmann does not mention the owner. In his description of Palazzo Pamfilj (that is, Doria) on p. 295 (where he locates the Bacchus and Ariadne) he gives the owner of the building as 'Prinz Doria aus Genua'-which is correct. Although Volkmann's statement that no. 35 hung in Palazzo Doria some time before 1770 is unsupported (for the reference of Titi: Descrizione, 1763, p. 320-'alcuni di Tiziano'-and of Chiusole: Itinerario, 1782, p. 265-'bei quadri di Tiziano'-to pictures in Palazzo Doria are too vague to constitute evidence either for or against) there seems no adequate reason to doubt it (the picture had, incidentally, very likely   hung there earlier, as the building hail been bought by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini in 1601). It may be relevant to add in this connection that a further Aldobrandini picture (no. 18, Luini of this Gallery) was recorded in Palazzo Doria in 1759 and 1763, and Bottari (ed. of Vasari, vol. 3, 1760, p. 379, note 1) says he believes the Bellini Bacchanal (which Ramdohr, 1787, p. 182, recorded in the Villa Aldobrandini and which had come with NG35 from Ferrara) was then in Palazzo Pamfili (Doria). \r\n\r\n[4]. The evidence for the year 1797 as the date of the sale comes from Waagen's statement that the Bellini Bacchanal, still at that time the companion of NG35, was bought in that year by Camuccini. \r\n\r\n[5]. Whitley says the picture had been brought to England in 1806. But Buchanan  says it was detained in Italy 'for a considerable time' after its purchase in May, 1806, and the Farington Diary (vol. 4, p. 115) describes it, implying a novelty, under the heading 'April 7, 1807'. \r\n\r\n[6]. Before the \"Kinnaird Sale\", inLondon, 5 March, 1813 (lot 88). In the copy in the National Gallery library of the 1813 Kinnaird sale catalogue NG35 ( together with two other pictures (NG62 and NG194) is stated to have been sold 'by private contract' to Delahante or Lafontaine. A letter of 7th July, 1813 from Delahante himself to Penrice (Penrice Letters, pp. 30-1) strongly implies that the purchaser was Delahante and not Lafontaine. \r\n\r\n[7]. Hamlet lent it in  1816  both to the Royal Academy, London  for copying and to the British  Institution, London, no 11.\r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n\r\n[a]. G. P.
