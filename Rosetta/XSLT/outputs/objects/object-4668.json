The Cretan princess Ariadne has been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance, at lower left. Bacchus, god of wine, is returning from a triumphal visit to India accompanied by his rowdy throng of followers: music-making nymphs clash cymbals and tambourines, a satyr wreathed with vine leaves holds a calf's leg aloft and a satyr child drags the calf's head along the ground. Drunken Silenus rides behind, slumped on an ass.Titian has captured the moment when Bacchus falls in love at first sight with Ariadne. The god leaps from his cheetah-drawn chariot; we see him suspended in mid-air in a way only rarely attempted by previous artists. Ariadne is initially afraid of Bacchus but he literally promises her the stars: in one version of the story, he later throws her wedding crown into the air, immortalising her as the constellation Corona Borealis, represented in the painting by the stars above her head.The story of Bacchus and Ariadne is told in different versions by several classical poets, most significantly Ovid and Catullus. From Catullus, Titian took the description of Ariadne deserted on the shore of Naxos and the wild train of Bacchus; from Ovid the meeting between the desperate, dishevelled, barefoot heroine and the young god.The painting is one of a famous series by Bellini, Titian and the Ferrarese artist Dosso Dossi, commissioned for the Camerino d'Alabastro (Alabaster Room) in the Ducal Palace, Ferrara, by Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. The Duke sent canvases of the right size to Titian in Venice so that the finished paintings would fit exactly in their intended location. It is not certain where exactly the Camerino was in the palace or how the works were arranged within it. However, it was probably a small room, and Bacchus and Ariadne is full of details which could be relished when the painting was examined closely. The landscape, the composition and its direction were calculated by Titian in relation to the other paintings in the room. Dosso's Bacchanal with Vulcan is now lost; he also contributed ten oblong canvases depicting scenes from Virgil's Aeneid that probably formed a frieze above the main canvases.The scheme was probably devised by a humanist scholar in the service of the Duke of Ferrara, who in around 1510 tried to include Michelangelo, Raphael and Fra Bartolommeo among the contributors. Bellini's Feast of the Gods (National Gallery of Art, Washington) for this room is dated 1514 and was later reworked by Titian, after he had finished his three paintings -- The Worship of Venus (Prado, Madrid), Bacchus and Ariadne and the Bacchanal of the Andrians (Prado, Madrid) were painted 1518--25. Titian began Bacchus and Ariadne in Venice in 1520 or 1522 and finished it at Ferrara early in 1523.Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne was a substitute for a painting on a similar subject which the Duke had commissioned from Raphael, who had died in 1520. Titian self-consciously attempted to emulate, and perhaps outdo, Raphael by drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, and depicting authentically classical costumes. He based the figure tangled in writhing snakes on the recently discovered and instantly famous ancient Roman sculpture of Laoco√∂n, excavated in Rome in 1506 (Vatican Museums, Rome).Titian shows off his great skill as a colourist in this picture, combining in a single canvas all the most vibrant pigments  available in Venice at the time. He didn't just use the finest quality pigments, but he also used them in their purest form, unmixed except with white to brighten them. He employed each pigment separately in large areas of colour, keeping them well spaced within the picture, and using them all at full strength to give the painting its rich, jewel-like quality. The ultramarine blue in the sky is the most intense colour and the purest pigment. The strength of blue in the sky varies as it does in nature, being more deeply blue overhead and brighter toward the horizon. The sky blue is differentiated from the slightly greenish blue of the distant landscape, painted with the pigment azurite.Titian's juxtaposition of strongly contrasting colours intensifies them, and his use of oil-rich glazes gives his colours greater depth. Yet the overall effect is harmonious. The different flesh tones -- from the pallor of Ariadne to the dark russet of the satyr with the snakes -- are picked up across the picture, providing a unifying link. The orange-brown tree in the top right corner is painted in ochre (iron oxide) colours. It was always intended to be rusty brown even though this is not an autumn landscape -- the iris, columbine and tender young vine shoots are more typical of late spring or early summer. Titian may have introduced the brown tree to provide a patch of warm contrasting colour at the top corner of the picture, and to continue the strong diagonal sweep through the earthy colours of the bodies down to the brown cheetahs, so drawing our eyes to Ariadne.He also exploited the textural qualities of the paint itself to add interest and variety to the areas of pure colour. The folds of the pale yellow drapery beneath the urn on which he signed his name are modelled with the brushstrokes rather than painted shadows. Titian became increasingly interested in the textural possibilities of paint, culminating in late works such as The Death of Actaeon, in which differentiated colour plays a lesser role in the composition than the texture and dynamism of the brushwork.Bacchus and Ariadne had an important influence on European art. The loves of the gods ceased to be a subject chiefly associated with furniture decoration and villa frescoes and became the most popular subject for gallery pictures, most notably in the poesie, the narrative paintings based on the Metamorphoses of Ovid, which Titian himself began to paint for King Philip II of Spain over 20 years later. Diana and Actaeon, Diana and Callisto and the Death of Actaeon from that series are now in the National Gallery's collection."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300435416","type":"Type","_label":"Description","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300418049","type":"Type","_label":"short text"}]}],"content":"One of the most famous paintings in the National Gallery, Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne illustrates a story told by the classical authors Ovid and Catullus.

The removal of NG35 to Rome by Cardinal Aldobrandini was little more than theft. Only five pictures were concerned-the four Bellini\/Titian Bacchanals and one by Dosso (see NG5279). The memorandum describes NG35 as 'una pittura in quadro di mano di Tiziano dove era dipinto Lacoonte'. Such indeed is how the figure of the satyr towards the right might appear at first sight or, as here, in retrospect (since the picture had already gone when the memorandum was written). Although Titian had probably not seen the La√∂co√∂n group when he   painted NG35 it is equally probable that its general appearance was known to him. At the same time the resemblance may be partly fortuitous, since the distinctive feature-the serpents writhing round the naked figure-occurs in Catullus. Included in Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's inventory of 1603 and in those of 1626, 1682 and an undated one (before 1665). Recorded in 1638 as in the Villa Aldobrandini, Rome. NG35 appears as no. 203 in the Aldobrandini inventories of 1605 and before 1665 (Palatino, 1964, p. 203) and as no. 100 in the 1626 inventory (Paola Della Pergola, 'Gli inventari Aldobrandin'i, Arte Antica e Moderna, 1960, p. 432) and as no. 314 in 1682 inventory (Poala Della Pergola, Arte Antica e Moderna, 'Gli inventari Aldobrandini. L‚Äôinventario del 1682', 1963, p. 74). \r\n\r\nThe writers referred to specify the location and at the same time use words which leave no doubt that the picture in question is NG35. Other writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are not referred to if references are vaguer-for example Ridolfi (Le Maraviglie dell'Arte) having described NG35 (p. 142), later gives its location (p. 178) simply as 'da gli heredi del Signor Cardinale Aldobrandino' It may be pointed out in this pace that Vasari, though describing the other Bacchanals at Ferrara, does not speak of NG35.  Gasp. Celio writes: 'Quella di Bacco ehe scende dal Carro e di Titiano-as in the Casino del Signor Principe Aldobrandini nel Montedetto Magnanapoli'.The Villa Aldobrandini at Rome is sometimes referred to in seventeenth-and eighteenth-century guidebooks, sometimes as Giardino Aldobrandini and sometimes as Villa Aldobrandini sopra al Quirinale, but there is no doubt that all refer to the same building. \r\n\r\n[2]. During this period the ownership had varied with the dynastic changes. The heir of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini  appears to have been Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini (son of Pietro's sister, Olimpia, who had married another Aldobrandini, Gianfrancesco) on whom, according to Litta, all the riches of the Aldobrandini family had devolved. Cardinal Ippolito, the last surviving Aldobrandini male of the main branch, entailing the estate and leaving as heir his niece, also called Olimpia (daughter of Ippolito's brother, Giorgio) and then her second son (by her second marriage-to Camillo Pamfilj) who had to take the name Aldobrandini. When this line too became extinct (in 1760) most of the Pamfili property passed to the Doria Landi while the Aldobrandini inheritance became the subject of a law suit between the Colonna and Borghese families, won by the latter in 1769. The judgement on that occasion was that the Aldobrandini fortune and title should be held by the second son of the head of the Borghese family. The confusion presumably prevailing over the inheritance between the years 1760 and 1769 may account for Volkmann's statement (published in 1770 but presumably referring to some time before) that NG35 was at the time of writing in the Palazzo Pamfili (that is, Palazzo Doria). Contrary to what is often stated NG35 appears never to have hung in the Palazzo Barberini. \r\n\r\nNikodemus Tessin in Studieresor, 1687-8 (ed. Sir√©n, 1914) p. 168 mentions' vier zimblich grosse Bachanalien vom Titiano' as in Palazzo Barberini and this was repeated by Carla Caterina Patina (Pitture Scelte, Cologne, 1691, p. 179) and by various eighteenth-century writers, while Milanesi (ed. of Vasari, VII, p. 434, note 1) and earlier editions of the National Gallery catalogue include the Barberini in the pedigree of NG35. The grounds for assuming that the pictures in question were copies are (a) the four original Bacchanals have never been together since the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Two were in Spain by 1638 (see W. N. Sainsbury: Original Unpublished Papers, Illustrative of ... Rubens, 1859, p. 353), (b) both Rossini (Il Mercurio Errante, 8th ed., 1760, p. 93) and the Roma Antica e Moderna (1765, II, p. 283) mention four Titian Bacchanals in Palazzo Barberini and also (pp. 271 and II, 607, respectively) NG35 as at the Villa Aldobrandini, (c) Orbaan (Documenti sul Barocco in Roma, 1920, p. 512) quotes a Barberini inventory of 1631 which says clearly that there was at that time in Palazzo Barberini a copy of what is certainly NG35, there stated as belonging to the Aldobrandini: 'un quadro d'un baccanario, con un satiretto, ehe tira la testa di un vitello, copiato dal Maltese da un di Titiano, che hanno li Signori Altobrandini, width about 6 Roman palmi'. \r\n\r\n[3]. The sojourn (in itself a little mysterious) of NG35 in Palazzo Doria seems at first to be rendered questionable by a curious statement of Ramdohr's  √† propos the Villa Aldobrandini that 'diese Villa geh√∂rt nicht dem Hause Doria, wie H. Dr. Volkmann schreibt, sondern dem Hause Borghese'. Unfortunately the reference to Volkmann's book given in this connection by Ramdohr ( vol. II, p. 233) is wrong (page 233 of that work is about something quite different) and it is difficult to be sure to which of Volkmann's remarks Ramdohr is referring. In his description of the Villa Aldobrandini (p. 825) Volkmann does not mention the owner. In his description of Palazzo Pamfilj (that is, Doria) on p. 295 (where he locates the Bacchus and Ariadne) he gives the owner of the building as 'Prinz Doria aus Genua'-which is correct. Although Volkmann's statement that no. 35 hung in Palazzo Doria some time before 1770 is unsupported (for the reference of Titi: Descrizione, 1763, p. 320-'alcuni di Tiziano'-and of Chiusole: Itinerario, 1782, p. 265-'bei quadri di Tiziano'-to pictures in Palazzo Doria are too vague to constitute evidence either for or against) there seems no adequate reason to doubt it (the picture had, incidentally, very likely   hung there earlier, as the building hail been bought by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini in 1601). It may be relevant to add in this connection that a further Aldobrandini picture (no. 18, Luini of this Gallery) was recorded in Palazzo Doria in 1759 and 1763, and Bottari (ed. of Vasari, vol. 3, 1760, p. 379, note 1) says he believes the Bellini Bacchanal (which Ramdohr, 1787, p. 182, recorded in the Villa Aldobrandini and which had come with NG35 from Ferrara) was then in Palazzo Pamfili (Doria). \r\n\r\n[4]. The evidence for the year 1797 as the date of the sale comes from Waagen's statement that the Bellini Bacchanal, still at that time the companion of NG35, was bought in that year by Camuccini. \r\n\r\n[5]. Whitley says the picture had been brought to England in 1806. But Buchanan  says it was detained in Italy 'for a considerable time' after its purchase in May, 1806, and the Farington Diary (vol. 4, p. 115) describes it, implying a novelty, under the heading 'April 7, 1807'. \r\n\r\n[6]. Before the \"Kinnaird Sale\", inLondon, 5 March, 1813 (lot 88). In the copy in the National Gallery library of the 1813 Kinnaird sale catalogue NG35 ( together with two other pictures (NG62 and NG194) is stated to have been sold 'by private contract' to Delahante or Lafontaine. A letter of 7th July, 1813 from Delahante himself to Penrice (Penrice Letters, pp. 30-1) strongly implies that the purchaser was Delahante and not Lafontaine. \r\n\r\n[7]. Hamlet lent it in  1816  both to the Royal Academy, London  for copying and to the British  Institution, London, no 11.\r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n\r\n[a]. G. P.
