class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Metamorphoses</span> (Book III, 138&ndash;255). Ovid tells how the noble young hunter, separated from his friends after a day&rsquo;s stag hunting, accidentally stumbles upon <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/1470409558\">Diana</a>, chaste goddess of the hunt, bathing in waters shaded by a ruinous structure.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Titian shows Actaeon bursting onto the scene and causing consternation among Diana&rsquo;s virgin nymphs, several of whom hastily seek to cover their voluptuous nudity. Not all appear entirely dismayed at the intrusion, but Diana is clearly furious. Titian explored the dramatic impact of the moment through a dynamic arrangement of figures, sparkling light, intense colour and animated brushwork. As her handmaiden helps cover her with a shift, Diana casts Actaeon a terrifying sidelong glance that foretells her cruel act of revenge. Actaeon raises his hands in surprise, as though already half aware of the deadly price he must pay for invading the goddess&rsquo;s privacy.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The scene is rich in portents anticipating Actaeon&rsquo;s death: the crumbling architecture is draped with the skins and skull of Diana&rsquo;s former prey, while in the background is a tiny vignette of the huntress chasing a stag, a foretaste of Actaeon&rsquo;s destiny as depicted in <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\"><a class=\"dokuwiki_link\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/4023659948\">The Death of Actaeon</a></span>.

In <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Diana and Actaeon</span>, Titian lightens the story&rsquo;s tragic plot with amusing details: Diana&rsquo;s lapdog yaps at Actaeon&rsquo;s athletic hound from the safety of the far bank.

The Roman author Plutarch&rsquo;s observation that &rsquo;Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is painting that speaks&lsquo; was frequently cited in favour of painting.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Twenty years earlier, Titian had created a series of mythological paintings with <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/2440797971\">Bellini</a> and <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/288309160\">Dosso Dossi</a> for <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/968626563\">Alfonso I d&rsquo;Este, Duke of Ferrara</a>, which included <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\"><a class=\"dokuwiki_link\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/2305086415\">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></span>. This series in Ferrara, particularly <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Bacchus and Ariadne</span>, had an important influence on European art &ndash; the loves of the gods became the most popular subject for gallery pictures. Although an advisor in the court of Alfonso d&lsquo;Este probably chose the subjects for the Duke&rsquo;s paintings, it seems clear that Titian himself chose those of the <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">poesie</span> he sent to Philip.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The first two paintings in the series for Philip, <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Dan&auml;e</span> (1549&ndash;50) and <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Venus and Adonis</span> (about 1552&ndash;4), both now in the Prado, Madrid, were variations of pictures Titian had painted before.

However, the light as depicted falls from opposite sides &ndash; from the left in <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Diana and Actaeon</span> and the right in <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Diana and Callisto</span>. This indicates that Titian had a placement between two windows in mind, even if only in the abstract &ndash; Philip was moving around at the time, and it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that he had a specific destination for the pictures.

Titian wrote again on 22 September to confirm that he was about to send the paintings. In this letter he stated that he had worked on them for more than three years, emphasising the exceptional efforts he had expended on the two pictures. He explained that the long time it had taken to paint them was due to &rsquo;the ardent desire that I have to do things that are worthy of Your Majesty, from which it follows that I am never satisfied with my efforts, but seek always with all my industry to polish and to enhance them&lsquo;. Another letter to the King from the Spanish Ambassador in Venice reveals that the artist had in fact continued to work on the paintings over the course of the summer: &rsquo;Titian will bring to perfection the two paintings of Diana and Callisto [sic] within twenty days because, since they are large and involve a lot of work, he wants to resolve a few little things that others wouldn&lsquo;t notice.&rsquo;</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Titian&rsquo;s many revisions to <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Diana and Actaeon</span>, where he changed his mind during painting, are visible beneath a complex tapestry of energetic brushwork. Forms are defined by transitions from one colour to another, broken by reflections and mingling in the shadows, rather than by linear contour. Tonal differences are translated directly into colour rather than initially worked out in black and white. The texture of paint, the track of Titian&rsquo;s gesture with brush and finger, enliven the surface of the picture and enhance its emotional charge. The paint surface remains relatively intact and Titian&rsquo;s jewel-like colours and loose, confident brushstrokes are remarkably well preserved.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\"><span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Diana and Actaeon</span> and <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\"><a class=\"dokuwiki_link\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/773721908\">Diana and Callisto</a></span> were probably first sent to Toledo, where the King was in residence, and then to the Royal Palace &ndash; the Alc&aacute;zar &ndash; in Madrid when the court moved there in May 1561.
