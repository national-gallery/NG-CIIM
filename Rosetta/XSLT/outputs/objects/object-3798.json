In secular portraits the dianthus symbolised friendship and often betrothal, which would also be appropriate here, as the Virgin was venerated as both the mother and bride of Christ.

The correspondence is so close as to suggest that Raphael was able to study Leonardo&rsquo;s picture at first hand, though it was painted some 30 years earlier. The cool colours, artful lighting, lively interaction of the figures and arrangement of the draperies all reflect Leonardo&rsquo;s work. Raphael has linked the heavenly and earthly worlds of the interior and exterior through his harmonious use of colour. His choice of blue-grey and yellow for the Virgin&rsquo;s clothes (rather than the traditional red and blue) may also relate to Leonardo&rsquo;s similarly unorthodox choice of colours in the <span class=\"dokuwiki_italic\">Benois Madonna</span>.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The painting, which is in excellent condition, is not much bigger than a <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/2897549189\">Book of Hours</a> (a personal prayer book), with the refinement of a manuscript illumination, and may have been intended to be held in the hand for prayer and contemplation.
