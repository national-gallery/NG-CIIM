It was a multi-part altarpiece known as a polyptych, and these panels would have formed part of the upper tier. We can tell this because the vaulted ceiling is painted as though viewed from below. The altarpiece was made for the church of San Francesco in Casale Monferrato, a town about 60 km east of Turin.Saint Peter Martyr was a Dominican friar from Verona. He holds a martyr's palm, while in his head is the hatchet with which perceived heretics assassinated him. The bishop may be Saint Evasio, of about the third century AD, who was a missionary and bishop of nearby Asti. He was beheaded by pagans in the forests surrounding Casale Monferrato and his relics are preserved in the Cathedral there.The other panels of the altarpiece are in Turin, Milan and a private collection. Saint Francis and Saint Agatha with Kneeling Donor (Accademia Albertina, Turin) was the left-hand panel of the main tier. The pattern of the haloes and the rosetted ceiling resembles those in the National Galleryâ€™s pictures and the style seems very similar. The altarpiece was dedicated to Saint Andrew and he was depicted in the main panel (Brera, Milan). The right-hand panel of the main tier was Saints Catherine and Sebastian (Brera, Milan). The halo and elaborately tiled floor patterns in the Brera panels are very like those in the Turin panel. The Turin and Milan panels are wider than those in the National Gallery, which have not been cut. This suggests that the upper tier was narrower than the main tier of the altarpiece, or that it was framed differently.The meticulously depicted luxury, humanity and sense of space in the main tier panels show the influence of Francesco del Cossa, with whom Spanzotti had worked in Bologna as a young man, Flemish and Burgundian painting, as well as the work of Foppa and Bramantino in Milan."},{"type":"LinguisticObject","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300435416","type":"Type","_label":"Description","classified_as":[{"id":"https:\/\/vocab.getty.edu\/aat\/300418049","type":"Type","_label":"short text"}]}],"content":"This painting and Saints Nicholas of Tolentino and John the Baptist are panels from the multi-part Dal Ponte Altarpiece, made for the church of San Francesco in Casale Monferrato.
