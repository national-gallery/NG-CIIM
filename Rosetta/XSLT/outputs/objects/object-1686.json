A richly dressed man and woman stand in a private room. Although it looks as if <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/2072624575\">Jan van Eyck</a> painted a real room exactly has he saw it, every object has been carefully chosen to proclaim the couple&rsquo;s wealth and social status without risking criticism for aping the aristocracy.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The house is of brick. Its window opens onto a garden, and a cherry tree can be glimpsed through the open shutters. The large and luxurious bed is covered with expensive red woollen cloth, and red cushions and fabric are scattered on the bedside chair and the bench. This is not a bedroom but a reception room, and the bed &ndash; the most expensive item of furniture in the house &ndash; is an essential part of its furnishings. The chair and bench are ornately carved, an oriental carpet lies on the floor and a splendid brass chandelier hangs from the ceiling. Even the carelessly scattered oranges indicate wealth; such fruit was extremely expensive. But this is not a palace: the floor is boarded and the walls are plastered rather than panelled or hung with tapestries. We are looking into a reception room in the comfortable, modern mansion of a wealthy merchant.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">The room&rsquo;s restrained luxury is equalled by the careful sartorial splendour of the couple. Their clothes are expensive and fashionable, but not flashy. The man wears a hat of plaited straw, and a dark tabard, probably of silk velvet, trimmed with brown fur. Under it is a black, possibly silk, doublet, with silver cuffs. His muddy pattens (overshoes) lie discarded on the floor.  The woman wears a fine green wool overdress with elaborate dagged sleeves and a long train which falls in thick folds around her feet. It is trimmed with a white fur, possibly ermine or squirrel belly. She is not pregnant, though she might look it: she is holding up her bulky gown in front of her, as ladies commonly did. Her hair is caught up in fashionable but modest horns, held in red nets, and covered with an intricately folded veil.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">So who are the people in this intimate setting? They are clearly husband and wife, and for many years the painting was understood as representing a marriage ceremony, though not anymore. From early on the painting was identified as showing one &lsquo;Hernoul le Fin&rsquo; or &lsquo;Arnoult Fin&rsquo;. The Arnolfini were an extensive family of Italian merchants, with various members in Bruges at this period. The most likely candidate is Giovanni di Nicolao di Arnolfini, known as Giannino or Jehannin, who would have been in his late thirties in 1434. The lady is probably his second wife, whose identity is unknown. They may have been friends of van Eyck &ndash; he painted another portrait of the man at an older age (Staatliche Museen, Berlin). A large round mirror hangs right in the centre of the composition, its convex glass showing not just the compressed and contorted room but also two men coming in through a door behind us. The first man seems to be raising his left arm and stepping down steps from the passage. Immediately above the mirror is a flamboyant signature:&nbsp;Johannes de Eyck fuit hic. 1434 (&lsquo;Jan van Eyck was here. 1434&rsquo;). Are the men in the mirror van Eyck himself and his servant, arriving on a visit?</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Technical analysis tell us much about how the picture was made. <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/3903811181\">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that the <a class=\"dokuwiki_nolink\" href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collections/dokuwiki/1359379275\">underdrawing</a> was done in stages. In the first one van Eyck sketched in the figures, the main pieces of furniture and the basic architecture of the room, but left out many of the objects for which the painting is now famous: the watchful terrier, the chandelier, the chair, the beads hanging on the wall and the discarded shoes. These were painted in at a late stage. Van Eyck also altered the man and woman&rsquo;s faces and bodies. In the initial underdrawing, Arnolfini had a larger face and even odder features. His feet were in a different position, his robe was shorter and his hat larger. His wife originally looked up towards her husband and her features were lower, so her forehead seemed even higher. Van Eyck often manipulated his sitters&lsquo; appearance to emphasise heads and hands, but here the faces, especially the man&rsquo;s, have been altered substantially. Arnolfini must have been a strange-looking man, and in the second underdrawing van Eyck improved his proportions and idealised his features.</p><p class=\"dokuwiki_paragraph\">Even the room itself if not a literal record of the couple&rsquo;s home. Although it looks as if van Eyck has simply removed a wall, close examination reveals inconsistencies. The chandelier cannot fit into the space it seems to occupy; there is no sign of a fireplace; the bed is too short and the ornate convex mirror on the back wall seems impossibly large.

Purchased by Don Diego de Guevara [about 1450-1520] [1]; gift, to Margaret of Austria [1480-1530], Mechlin (Mechelen/Malines), Belgium [2]; by descent to her neice, Mary of Hungary [1505-1558], Spain [3] [b]; by descent to her nephew, Philip II, King of Spain [1527-1598], in Salle chiqua, Alcázar, Madrid, Spain, 1558; by descent to Charles II, King of Spain [1661-1700], Madrid, Spain [c]; by descent to Charles III, King of Spain [1759-1788], Retrete, Cuarto del Rey, Palacio Nuevo, Madrid, Spain, by 1794 [4] [d]. Appropriated, or purchased, by James Hay [-1854], between 1813 and 1815 [5]; purchased by the National Gallery, June 1842 (for £600). \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[1]. Spanish nobleman of the Burgundian court, who died in Brussels, and whose coat of arms were reported as being on the lost wing panels or shutters.\r\n\r\n[2]. Number 1 in her palace inventory, 15 July 1516 (as of 'Hernoul le Fin and his wife in a chamber') and recorded later inventories of 9 July 1523 and 17 April 1524.\r\n\r\n[3]. Described in her posthumous inventory, 1558.\r\n\r\n[4]. In 1789-90 inventory.\r\n\r\n[5]. Presumably it left Spain during Peninsular War, 1807-1814. Hay was a Scottish soldier in 16th Light Dragoons in the Battle of Vitoria, 1813; and according to the Duke of Wellington, he obtained Joseph Bonaparte's baggage that contained an Imperial, part of his coach, full of works of art from the Spanish royal collection. According to Chrétien-Jean Nieuwenhuys [1799-1883] in Description de la Galeries des tableaux de S. M. Le Roi des Pays-Bas, Brussels 1843, Hay saw it, whilst recuperating from wounds, probably after Battle of Waterloo, 18 June 1815, in Brussels and apparently acquired it then. Hay offered it to the Prince Regent in 1816 immediately after his return to England, and Sir Thomas Lawrence sent it to Carlton House, London, 10 October 1816, where it was recorded in a December 1816 inventory as being in the middle attic next to the Prince's bedroom but returned to Lawrence on 25 April 1818. Hay entrusted it to Dr James Wardrop [1782-1869], Charles II Street, London where it remained, between two windows in a bedroom, for 13 years. Exhibited at British Institution, 1841, no. 14.\r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n\r\n[a]. A. Le Glay, Correspondence de l'empereur Maximilien Ier at Marguerite d' Autriche, sa fille published in L.
