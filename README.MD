# NG-CIIM

A repository for the development of Gallery-instigated CIIM configurations and plugins (but *not* the Gallery's CIIM itself).

We're starting with JOLT transformations to plug in to Rosetta.

## A note about branches

- **main** will be used for production tools that are incorporated into the Gallery's live infrastructure
- Once this has been set up, future development work that is *signed off for inclusion* in the production infrastructure will be developed in the **dev** branch
- *All other* development work will take place in **separate branches**
